# SWC-Account-Books-Sample
This is a sample of how I kept track of my club financial records. 

I managed to cut down 80% of accounting work by making it semi-automatic through pivot tables and slicers.
The only manual tasks is to key-in the records, refreshing the excel file, and updating the monthly financial statements 
to better suit Sunway Student Life's requirements.
